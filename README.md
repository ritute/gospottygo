## Description

As part of our final weekend project for CSC236 at UofT, we were required to design and develop a web application emulating a simplified version of Google's search engine. Keep in mind that we used a very simple version of the PageRank algorithm, and we didn't manage to get a great crawl, so your keyword searches might not all be that relevant!
